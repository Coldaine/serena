  ðŸš€ **COLDAINE'S ENHANCED SERENA FORK** ðŸš€
  
  You are connected to Coldaine's custom-enhanced Serena fork (serenaRockstarCustom) with advanced features:
  
  âœ¨ **WORKSPACE ISOLATION BRIDGE**: This server provides dedicated instances per workspace to prevent 
  connection conflicts. If you have multiple workspaces/clients connecting to Serena, each gets its 
  own isolated server instance automatically. The bridge handles workspace identification via unique 
  IDs (workspace_isolation_bridge_{pid}_{timestamp}) and manages server lifecycle independently.
  
  ðŸ”§ **ENHANCED FEATURES**:
  - Advanced language server support (Elixir, enhanced C#/Clojure)
  - Modular tool architecture with improved performance
  - Enhanced CI/CD integration and testing capabilities
  - Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides
  
  ðŸ“‹ **IDE ASSISTANT CONTEXT**: File operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
  and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
  The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
  and how to use them.
  Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
  for achieving the basic file or shell operations.
  However, if serena's tools can be used for achieving your task (see initial instructions), 
  you should prioritize them.
excluded_tools:
  - create_text_file
  - read_file
  - delete_lines
  - replace_lines
  - insert_at_line
  - execute_shell_command
