# **Rigorous by Design: A Comprehensive Guide to Testing Model Context Protocol Servers and Proxies**

## **Section 1: The Imperative of Protocol-Level Testing for MCP**

### **Introduction: Beyond SDK-Based Testing**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, represents a significant step toward standardizing the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools and data sources. Envisioned as a "USB-C port for AI applications", MCP provides a common language that allows diverse systems—from IDEs like VS Code to custom AI agents—to discover and utilize capabilities exposed by compliant servers. The protocol's architecture, which takes inspiration from the highly successful Language Server Protocol (LSP), is built upon stateful, session-based communication using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages. This design enables rich, contextual interactions far beyond the scope of simple, stateless request-response patterns.

For developers and quality assurance engineers tasked with building and maintaining MCP servers, this architecture presents unique testing challenges. While the official Software Development Kits (SDKs) for languages like Python, TypeScript, and Java are invaluable for rapid application development, they are, by their very nature, insufficient for comprehensive server validation. SDKs are designed to be "good clients"; they abstract away the complexities of the protocol and guide developers toward correct usage, often programmatically preventing the submission of malformed, ill-timed, or logically invalid requests.

However, a truly robust server must be resilient not only to well-behaved clients but also to those that are misconfigured, malicious, or simply buggy. It must gracefully handle protocol violations, manage state correctly under duress, and provide clear, actionable error messages. Verifying this resilience requires a testing methodology that operates at the raw protocol level, deliberately stepping outside the guardrails of high-level SDKs. This report provides an exhaustive guide to such a methodology, detailing how to programmatically simulate client interactions, test complex proxy architectures, and implement a multi-layered validation strategy to ensure that MCP servers are not just functional but rigorously hardened for production environments.

### **The State-of-the-Art in MCP**

MCP is an open standard designed to solve the "M×N integration problem," where M applications need to connect to N different tools, by creating a common API layer. Instead of building custom integrations for each pair, application developers build M clients and tool creators build N servers, dramatically reducing complexity.

The protocol's architecture is fundamentally stateful. A connection is not a single transaction but a session with a distinct lifecycle. This lifecycle begins with an initialize handshake, during which the client and server exchange their respective capabilities and agree on a protocol version. Once initialized, the session persists, allowing for a sequence of interactions—such as discovering available tools, invoking them, and reading resources—all within a shared context. This is a critical departure from stateless protocols like REST. A test that sends a tools/call request without a preceding initialize handshake is not just a negative test; it is a test of a fundamental protocol violation. A server's response to such a sequence reveals much about its robustness. Consequently, testing an MCP server is a hybrid discipline, blending the techniques of traditional API testing with the stateful validation required for conversational protocols like FTP or a database connection. This understanding informs every strategy and technique detailed in this report.

## **Section 2: Programmatic Client Simulation: Crafting Raw MCP Interactions**

To rigorously test an MCP server, it is essential to simulate client behavior at the lowest possible level, crafting raw requests without the abstractions of an SDK. This approach is the only way to perform comprehensive negative testing, such as sending malformed data or violating the protocol's stateful lifecycle. The following subsections provide practical, hands-on examples for simulating an MCP client using common command-line and scripting tools.

The primary value of these low-level scripts lies in their ability to facilitate "negative path" and "protocol violation" testing. High-level SDKs are engineered to prevent developers from making common mistakes, such as invoking a tool before the session is initialized. A test suite, however, must be capable of simulating these exact scenarios to verify the server's error handling and resilience. A robust server must handle a misbehaving client that violates the prescribed initialize \-\> initialized \-\> operation lifecycle. When a tools/call request arrives before initialization, the server should not crash or enter an undefined state; it should respond with a specific, informative JSON-RPC error. Only by crafting raw requests can a test engineer simulate these protocol violations and validate the server's defensive posture.

### **2.1 The Universal Tool: cURL for Streamable HTTP/SSE**

For MCP servers that utilize the Streamable HTTP transport with Server-Sent Events (SSE)—a common choice for remote servers—the command-line tool cURL is indispensable for initial health checks and scripted interactions.

A cURL command to invoke a tool on a local server demonstrates the key components of a raw MCP request. The following example, based on the pattern found in developer tutorials, is annotated to highlight each critical element:

Bash

curl \-i \-X POST \\  
  \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\  
  \-H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \\  
  \-H "mcp-version: 2025-06-18" \\  
  \-d '{  
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",  
    "id": 1,  
    "method": "tools/call",  
    "params": {  
      "name": "get\_weather",  
      "arguments": {  
        "city": "Tokyo"  
      }  
    }  
  }' \\  
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp

**Breakdown of the cURL Command:**

* curl \-i \-X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp: The \-X POST flag specifies the HTTP method. The \-i flag includes the HTTP response headers in the output, which is crucial for validation. The URL points to the server's MCP endpoint.  
* \-H "Content-Type: application/json": This header is mandatory and informs the server that the request body is a JSON object.  
* \-H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream": This header signals to the server that the client is capable of handling either a standard, single JSON response or a continuous stream of Server-Sent Events. This is important for servers that might send progress notifications or other asynchronous messages.  
* \-H "mcp-version: 2025-06-18": Specifies the version of the MCP specification the client is adhering to. This is a critical part of the capability negotiation process initiated during the handshake.  
* \-d '{...}': The request body, containing the JSON-RPC 2.0 payload. It includes the jsonrpc version, a unique request id for correlating responses, the method to be invoked (tools/call), and the params object containing the tool's name and arguments.

### **2.2 The Pythonic Approach: requests, sseclient-py, and websockets**

Python is a dominant language in test automation. While the official MCP Python SDK provides a high-level client, building tests from more fundamental libraries allows for greater control.

#### **2.2.1 Testing HTTP/SSE Transports**

This script uses the requests library for sending the initial POST request and sseclient-py to consume the resulting event stream.

Python

import requests  
import json  
import sseclient

\# Define the server endpoint and headers  
url \= "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"  
headers \= {  
    "Content-Type": "application/json",  
    "Accept": "text/event-stream",  
    "mcp-version": "2025-06-18"  
}

\# Construct the JSON-RPC 2.0 payload  
payload \= {  
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",  
    "id": "test-001",  
    "method": "tools/call",  
    "params": {  
        "name": "get\_weather",  
        "arguments": {"city": "London"}  
    }  
}

\# Use requests.post with stream=True to handle SSE  
response \= requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload), stream=True)  
response.raise\_for\_status() \# Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx or 5xx)

\# Use sseclient-py to parse the event stream  
client \= sseclient.SSEClient(response)

print("--- Received SSE Events \---")  
for event in client.events():  
    print(f"Event Type: {event.event}")  
    print(f"Event Data: {json.loads(event.data)}")  
    \# In a real test, you would add assertions here

#### **2.2.2 Testing WebSocket Transports**

For servers using WebSocket transport, the websockets library provides an asynchronous client for establishing persistent connections.

Python

import asyncio  
import websockets  
import json

async def test\_websocket\_mcp\_server():  
    uri \= "ws://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"  
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:  
        \# 1\. Send the initialize request  
        init\_payload \= {  
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",  
            "id": 1,  
            "method": "mcp/v1/initialize",  
            "params": {  
                "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",  
                "clientInfo": {"name": "test-client", "version": "1.0.0"},  
                "capabilities": {}  
            }  
        }  
        await websocket.send(json.dumps(init\_payload))  
        init\_response \= await websocket.recv()  
        print(f"Received Initialization Response: {init\_response}")  
        \# Add assertions for the init response here

        \# 2\. Send the initialized notification  
        initialized\_notification \= {  
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",  
            "method": "mcp/v1/initialized",  
            "params": {}  
        }  
        await websocket.send(json.dumps(initialized\_notification))

        \# 3\. Now, call a tool  
        tool\_call\_payload \= {  
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",  
            "id": 2,  
            "method": "tools/call",  
            "params": {"name": "get\_weather", "arguments": {"city": "Paris"}}  
        }  
        await websocket.send(json.dumps(tool\_call\_payload))  
        tool\_response \= await websocket.recv()  
        print(f"Received Tool Response: {tool\_response}")  
        \# Add assertions for the tool response here

if \_\_name\_\_ \== "\_\_main\_\_":  
    asyncio.run(test\_websocket\_mcp\_server())

### **2.3 The Node.js Toolkit: axios and ws**

For projects within the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, axios and ws are the standard libraries for low-level HTTP and WebSocket communication, respectively.

#### **2.3.1 Testing HTTP/SSE Transports**

This script uses axios to make the POST request and listens to the streaming data events.

JavaScript

const axios \= require('axios');  
const { Writable } \= require('stream');

const url \= 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp';  
const headers \= {  
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',  
    'Accept': 'text/event-stream',  
    'mcp-version': '2025-06-18'  
};  
const payload \= {  
    jsonrpc: '2.0',  
    id: 'node-test-001',  
    method: 'tools/call',  
    params: {  
        name: 'get\_weather',  
        arguments: { city: 'New York' }  
    }  
};

async function testHttpSseMcpServer() {  
    try {  
        const response \= await axios.post(url, payload, {  
            headers: headers,  
            responseType: 'stream'  
        });

        console.log('--- Received SSE Stream \---');  
        response.data.on('data', (chunk) \=\> {  
            // SSE messages are typically newline-separated \`data:...\` lines  
            const lines \= chunk.toString().trim().split('\\n');  
            for (const line of lines) {  
                if (line.startsWith('data:')) {  
                    const jsonData \= line.substring(5).trim();  
                    console.log('Event Data:', JSON.parse(jsonData));  
                    // Add assertions here in a real test  
                }  
            }  
        });

        response.data.on('end', () \=\> {  
            console.log('Stream finished.');  
        });

    } catch (error) {  
        console.error('Error:', error.message);  
    }  
}

testHttpSseMcpServer();

#### **2.3.2 Testing WebSocket Transports**

The ws library is the de facto standard for WebSocket clients in Node.js.

JavaScript

const WebSocket \= require('ws');

const uri \= 'ws://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp';  
const ws \= new WebSocket(uri);

ws.on('open', function open() {  
    console.log('WebSocket connection opened.');

    // 1\. Send initialize request  
    const initPayload \= {  
        jsonrpc: '2.0',  
        id: 1,  
        method: 'mcp/v1/initialize',  
        params: { /\*... as in Python example... \*/ }  
    };  
    ws.send(JSON.stringify(initPayload));  
});

ws.on('message', function incoming(data) {  
    const message \= JSON.parse(data);  
    console.log('Received message:', message);

    // Simple state machine to progress the test  
    if (message.id \=== 1 && message.result) {  
        // 2\. Received init response, send initialized notification  
        const initializedNotification \= {  
            jsonrpc: '2.0',  
            method: 'mcp/v1/initialized',  
            params: {}  
        };  
        ws.send(JSON.stringify(initializedNotification));

        // 3\. Now call a tool  
        const toolCallPayload \= {  
            jsonrpc: '2.0',  
            id: 2,  
            method: 'tools/call',  
            params: { name: 'get\_weather', arguments: { city: 'Berlin' } }  
        };  
        ws.send(JSON.stringify(toolCallPayload));  
    } else if (message.id \=== 2 && message.result) {  
        // 4\. Received tool response, end test  
        console.log('Test complete.');  
        ws.close();  
    }  
});

ws.on('close', function close() {  
    console.log('WebSocket connection closed.');  
});

ws.on('error', function error(err) {  
    console.error('WebSocket error:', err);  
});

## **Section 3: Anatomy of an MCP Message: A Definitive Reference**

A deep understanding of the MCP message structure is paramount for writing effective tests. All communication is built upon the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, which defines a lightweight and clear format for remote procedure calls. This section serves as a practical reference, providing concrete examples of the most common and critical MCP messages.

### **3.1 The JSON-RPC 2.0 Foundation**

Every MCP message is a JSON object with the following key fields:

* jsonrpc: A string that MUST be exactly "2.0".  
* method: A string containing the name of the method to be invoked (e.g., mcp/v1/initialize, tools/call). This is present in requests and notifications.  
* params: A structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the method invocation. Can be an array or an object. MCP primarily uses objects.  
* id: A unique identifier established by the client for a request. It can be a string or a number. The server MUST reply with a response containing the same id. This field is crucial for matching responses to requests in an asynchronous environment. It is omitted for notifications, which do not require a response.  
* result: This field is included in a successful response object and contains the value returned by the server-side method. It is mutually exclusive with the error field.  
* error: This field is included in a failed response object and contains an object with code, message, and optional data fields. It is mutually exclusive with the result field.

### **3.2 Key Request and Response Structures**

The following table provides canonical, copy-pasteable examples of the raw JSON payloads for fundamental MCP lifecycle messages. Developers can use these as a baseline for creating test data.

| Method Name | Request Payload Example | Successful Response (result) Example | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| mcp/v1/initialize | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"mcp/v1/initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","clientInfo":{"name":"test-client","version":"1.0.0"},"capabilities":{}}} | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","serverInfo":{"name":"example-server","version":"1.0.0"},"capabilities":{"tools":{"listChanged":true}}}} | The first message sent by a client to initiate a session. It declares the client's identity and capabilities, allowing the server to respond with its own, establishing a contract for the session. |
| tools/list | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}} | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"result":{"tools":}}\]}} | A client request to discover the tools offered by the server. The response is a list of tool definitions, each with a name, description, and a JSON Schema for its inputs. This is how an AI agent learns what it can do. |
| tools/call | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get\_weather","arguments":{"city":"London"}}} | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"result":{"content":}} | The core action request. The client asks the server to execute a specific tool with the provided arguments. The server executes the underlying logic and returns a structured result. |
| resources/read | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"resources/read","params":{"uri":"file:///path/to/document.txt"}} | {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"result":{"contents":}} | A request to retrieve the content of a read-only resource, identified by its URI. This is how context is provided to the LLM without invoking a tool with side effects. |

### **3.3 Understanding MCP Error Responses**

Proper error handling is a hallmark of a robust server. A test suite should not only check that errors occur when expected but that the *correct* error is returned. The following table maps standard JSON-RPC error codes to likely causes within an MCP context, enabling more precise test assertions.

| Error Code | Standard Name | Likely MCP Cause | Example Test Scenario |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \-32700 | Parse Error | The server received data that was not valid JSON. | Send a request with a malformed JSON body, such as {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call". |
| \-32600 | Invalid Request | The received JSON was not a valid JSON-RPC 2.0 Request object. | Send a valid JSON object that is missing a required field, like {"id": 1, "method": "tools/call"} (missing jsonrpc). |
| \-32601 | Method Not Found | The requested method does not exist or is not available in the current session state. | Attempt to call a tool that the server does not expose, or attempt to call tools/call before the initialize handshake is complete. |
| \-32602 | Invalid Params | The parameters provided for a method were invalid. | Call a tool with missing required arguments, or with arguments of the wrong data type (e.g., a number where a string is expected). |
| \-32603 | Internal Error | A generic, unhandled exception occurred on the server during the processing of the request. | This error indicates a server-side bug. Tests should assert that the message and data fields do not leak sensitive information like stack traces or internal file paths. |
| \-32000 to \-32099 | Server-defined Error | The protocol reserves this range for implementation-specific errors. | This is the correct range for protocol-level errors. For example, a server could define \-32001 as "Authentication Required" or \-32002 as "Session Not Initialized". |

## **Section 4: Advanced Testing Strategies for MCP Proxy Servers**

As the MCP ecosystem matures, proxy or gateway servers are becoming a common architectural pattern. These proxies act as intermediaries, aggregating multiple downstream MCP servers and exposing them to clients through a single, unified endpoint. This architecture simplifies client configuration but introduces significant testing complexity. A proxy is not merely a passive forwarder; it is an active manager of namespaces, sessions, and connections. A comprehensive testing strategy must validate these advanced responsibilities.

### **4.1 Verifying Request Routing and Namespace Management**

When a proxy aggregates tools from multiple downstream servers, the potential for tool name collisions is high. For instance, two different backend servers might both expose a tool named search. The proxy must implement a clear strategy for disambiguation and routing. The test strategy must therefore focus on verifying the correctness of this namespace virtualization.

A failure in namespace management means clients cannot reliably address the tools they need, undermining the core purpose of the proxy. Implementations like pluggedin-mcp-proxy and mcp-proxy use mechanisms like name prefixing or path-based routing to solve this. Others, like the LiteLLM gateway, can use custom headers such as x-mcp-servers for explicit, on-demand routing.

**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Arrange:** In a test environment, deploy the proxy server along with two mock downstream MCP servers (e.g., MockServerA and MockServerB). These can be created using libraries like jest-websocket-mock or simple web frameworks. Configure both mocks to expose a tool with an identical name, such as search.  
2. **Act (Discovery):** Write a test that simulates a client connecting to the proxy and sending a tools/list request.  
3. **Assert (Disambiguation):** The test must assert that the proxy's disambiguation strategy is working correctly.  
   * If the strategy is name prefixing, assert that the list of tools returned by the proxy contains names like MockServerA\_search and MockServerB\_search.  
   * If the strategy involves metadata, assert that each search tool definition in the response contains a unique identifier pointing to its origin server.  
4. **Act & Assert (Targeted Invocation):**  
   * Send a tools/call request to the proxy for the disambiguated tool name (e.g., MockServerA\_search).  
   * Assert that the request was received *only* by MockServerA and that MockServerB received no traffic.  
   * If the proxy uses header-based routing, send a tools/call for the generic name search but include a header like X-MCP-Target-Server: MockServerA. Again, assert that only the correct mock server received the call.

### **4.2 Testing for Collision Avoidance and Session Integrity**

As a stateful protocol, MCP demands strict session isolation. A proxy handling connections from multiple concurrent clients to various downstream servers must act as a "session guardian," ensuring there is no leakage of state or capabilities between them. A failure here represents a critical security and stability vulnerability.

**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Arrange:** Configure the proxy to connect to two functionally distinct mock downstream servers, for example, an AuthServer exposing a login tool and a DataServer exposing a get\_records tool.  
2. **Act (Concurrent Sessions):** Using an asynchronous testing framework (like pytest-asyncio or native Promise.all in Jest), simulate two clients, ClientA and ClientB, connecting to the proxy *concurrently*.  
   * ClientA's test logic should connect to the proxy and initialize a session specifically with the AuthServer (this might be done via a specific URL path on the proxy, e.g., proxy.com/auth, or another routing mechanism).  
   * ClientB's test logic should concurrently connect and initialize a session with the DataServer.  
3. **Assert (State and Capability Isolation):**  
   * Within ClientA's logic, after initialization, list its available tools. Assert that the response contains *only* the login tool from AuthServer and *not* the get\_records tool from DataServer.  
   * Concurrently, within ClientB's logic, list its tools. Assert that it sees *only* the get\_records tool.  
   * As a final check, have ClientA attempt to call the get\_records tool. Assert that the proxy correctly rejects this request, returning a MethodNotFound error (code \-32601), because that tool is not part of ClientA's isolated session.

### **4.3 Validating Multiplexing and Performance**

The proxy is a natural chokepoint in the system architecture and a potential performance bottleneck. It must be able to efficiently manage, or "multiplex," a large number of simultaneous client connections without introducing significant latency or consuming excessive resources.

**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Arrange:** Set up the proxy with a single, highly performant mock downstream server. This mock should expose a simple, fast-responding tool like ping that returns a minimal payload immediately upon being called. This ensures that any measured latency is attributable to the proxy, not the backend.  
2. **Act (Load Test):** Employ a dedicated load testing framework such as Locust (for Python) or k6 (for JavaScript/Go). Create a test script that simulates a typical user lifecycle:  
   * Establish a connection (HTTP/SSE or WebSocket).  
   * Perform the initialize handshake.  
   * In a loop, call the ping tool a fixed number of times (e.g., 10).  
   * Gracefully shut down the connection.  
3. **Ramp Up:** Execute the load test with a progressively increasing number of concurrent users (e.g., ramp from 1 to 500 users over a period of 5 minutes).  
4. **Assert (Measure and Monitor):** During the test run, monitor and record key performance indicators (KPIs). The assertions are based on thresholds set for these KPIs.  
   * **Latency:** Track the average and 95th percentile (P95) response times for the ping tool invocation. A sharp, non-linear increase in latency as user load increases is a clear sign of a bottleneck in the proxy.  
   * **Error Rate:** Monitor the percentage of failed requests (e.g., HTTP 5xx errors, timeouts, or JSON-RPC errors). This rate should remain near zero. Any increase indicates the proxy is becoming overwhelmed.  
   * **Proxy Resource Usage:** Use system monitoring tools to track the CPU and memory consumption of the proxy process itself. Unbounded memory growth could indicate a memory leak in session handling.

## **Section 5: A Developer's Toolkit: Frameworks and Libraries for MCP Testing**

Implementing the strategies described requires a robust set of testing tools. The choice of framework is typically dictated by the project's primary language. This section provides actionable recommendations and code patterns for both the Python and Node.js ecosystems.

### **5.1 The Python Ecosystem: pytest, httpx, and websockets**

For Python-based MCP servers, the combination of pytest, pytest-asyncio, and httpx provides a powerful and flexible testing stack.

* **Framework:** pytest is the de facto standard for testing in Python due to its simple assertion syntax, powerful fixture model, and extensive plugin ecosystem. The pytest-asyncio plugin is essential for testing asynchronous code, which is typical for MCP servers.  
* **HTTP/SSE Testing:** The httpx library is a modern, fully featured HTTP client that supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests, making it a perfect fit for pytest-asyncio. A test can be written as an async def function, using httpx.AsyncClient to interact with the server.  
  Python  
  import pytest  
  import httpx  
  from your\_mcp\_server import app \# Assuming a FastAPI/Starlette app

  @pytest.mark.asyncio  
  async def test\_initialize\_request():  
      async with httpx.AsyncClient(app=app, base\_url="http://test") as client:  
          payload \= {  
              "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "mcp/v1/initialize", "params": { /\*... \*/ }  
          }  
          response \= await client.post("/mcp", json=payload)

          assert response.status\_code \== 200  
          response\_data \= response.json()  
          assert response\_data\["id"\] \== 1  
          assert "result" in response\_data  
          assert response\_data\["result"\]\["serverInfo"\]\["name"\] \== "your-server-name"

* **WebSocket Testing:** The websockets library is the premier choice for low-level WebSocket interactions in Python. It can be used directly within a pytest-asyncio test to simulate a full client session.  
  Python  
  import pytest  
  import websockets  
  import json

  @pytest.mark.asyncio  
  async def test\_websocket\_tool\_call(running\_server\_url): \# Fixture provides running server  
      async with websockets.connect(f"{running\_server\_url}/ws") as websocket:  
          \# Perform handshake and other prerequisite steps...  
          tool\_payload \= {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 10, "method": "tools/call", "params": {}}  
          await websocket.send(json.dumps(tool\_payload))  
          response\_str \= await websocket.recv()  
          response\_data \= json.loads(response\_str)

          assert response\_data\["id"\] \== 10  
          assert "result" in response\_data

### **5.2 The Node.js/TypeScript Ecosystem: Jest, superwstest, and jest-websocket-mock**

For projects built on Node.js and TypeScript, Jest provides a comprehensive "all-in-one" testing framework.

* **Framework:** Jest includes a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities out of the box, making it a popular choice for streamlined test development.1  
* **Integrated HTTP/WS Testing:** The superwstest library is an excellent tool for testing MCP servers because it extends the widely-used supertest API to include WebSocket testing. This allows for clean, chainable assertions for both HTTP and WebSocket endpoints within the same test suite.  
  JavaScript  
  const request \= require('superwstest');  
  const server \= require('./your-mcp-server'); // Your http.Server instance

  describe('MCP Server Endpoints', () \=\> {  
    afterEach(() \=\> {  
      server.close();  
    });

    it('responds to HTTP health check', async () \=\> {  
      await request(server).get('/health').expect(200);  
    });

    it('communicates over WebSockets', async () \=\> {  
      await request(server)  
       .ws('/mcp')  
       .sendJson({ jsonrpc: '2.0', id: 1, method: 'mcp/v1/initialize', params: {} })  
       .expectJson((res) \=\> {  
          expect(res.id).toBe(1);  
          expect(res.result).toBeDefined();  
        })  
       .close()  
       .expectClosed();  
    });  
  });

* **Mocking WebSocket Servers:** The jest-websocket-mock library is a powerful utility for creating mock WebSocket servers directly within tests. This is invaluable for the proxy testing strategies outlined in Section 4, where multiple mock downstream servers are required. It allows tests to control the server's behavior, such as sending pre-defined messages upon connection or asserting on messages received from the client under test.  
  JavaScript  
  import WS from 'jest-websocket-mock';

  describe('MCP Proxy Client Logic', () \=\> {  
    let server;  
    beforeEach(() \=\> {  
      server \= new WS('ws://localhost:1234', { jsonProtocol: true });  
    });  
    afterEach(() \=\> {  
      WS.clean();  
    });

    it('should connect and send an initialize request', async () \=\> {  
      // Code that initializes your client and connects to 'ws://localhost:1234'  
      const client \= new YourMCPClient('ws://localhost:1234');  
      await client.connect();

      // Assert that the mock server received the correct initialization message  
      await expect(server).toReceiveMessage({  
        jsonrpc: '2.0',  
        method: 'mcp/v1/initialize',  
        //... other params  
      });

      // Send a response back from the mock server  
      server.send({ jsonrpc: '2.0', id: 1, result: { /\*... \*/ } });  
    });  
  });

## **Section 6: Ensuring Correctness: A Multi-Layered Assertion and Validation Strategy**

A single test case for an MCP server should perform more than a single assertion. A comprehensive validation approach involves checking the server's response at multiple distinct layers. A failure at each layer points to a different class of bug, allowing engineers to pinpoint the root cause of a problem with greater precision. This layered model provides a systematic framework for building a truly rigorous test suite. A failure in the Transport layer, for instance, might indicate a server crash, whereas a failure in the Schema layer points to a mismatch between a tool's implementation and its advertised contract.

### **6.1 Layer 1: Transport and HTTP-Level Assertions**

This is the most fundamental layer of validation, ensuring that the underlying communication channel is functioning correctly.

* **HTTP Status Codes:** For HTTP-based transports, every response should be checked for the correct status code. A successful request should yield a 200 OK. Authentication or authorization failures should result in 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden, respectively. A client-side error (like a malformed request) should ideally result in a 400 Bad Request, while unexpected server-side crashes should produce a 500 Internal Server Error.  
* **HTTP Headers:** Assert that the response includes the correct Content-Type header. For standard JSON-RPC responses, this should be application/json. For streaming responses, it should be text/event-stream for SSE.  
* **Connection State:** For WebSockets, the test should assert that the connection is successfully established and can be gracefully closed. An unexpected disconnection is a test failure.

### **6.2 Layer 2: Protocol-Level (JSON-RPC) Assertions**

This layer validates the structural integrity of the MCP message envelope itself, ensuring the server speaks valid JSON-RPC 2.0.

* **Valid JSON:** The first check is to ensure the response body can be successfully parsed as JSON.  
* **jsonrpc Version:** Assert that the jsonrpc field in the response object is a string with the exact value "2.0".  
* **Request/Response ID Correlation:** This is a critical assertion for stateful, asynchronous clients. Assert that the id field in the response object is present and exactly matches the id sent in the corresponding request. A mismatch or missing id breaks the client's ability to correlate responses.  
* **Mutual Exclusivity of result and error:** Assert that a single response object does not contain both a result field and an error field. The JSON-RPC specification mandates that they are mutually exclusive.

### **6.3 Layer 3: Payload Schema Validation**

This is arguably the most critical validation layer for ensuring the reliability of AI agent interactions. When a server lists its tools via tools/list, it makes a promise. The inputSchema in each tool definition is a contract that dictates the structure of the tool's arguments. The structure of the data returned in the result field of a tools/call response is an implicit contract. The agent's ability to reliably chain tool calls depends on these contracts being upheld.

This is where schema validation libraries become indispensable. Tools like Pydantic for Python and Zod for TypeScript provide a declarative way to define data structures and validate incoming data against them at runtime.

#### **Python Example with Pydantic**

In a pytest test, after receiving a response from a tool call, the result object can be parsed into a Pydantic model. If the data does not conform to the model's schema, Pydantic will raise a ValidationError, automatically failing the test with a detailed error message.

Python

import pytest  
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError

\# Define the expected schema for the 'get\_weather' tool's output  
class WeatherReport(BaseModel):  
    location: str  
    temperature: float  
    unit: str \= Field(pattern="^(Celsius|Fahrenheit)$")  
    conditions: str

\# Inside a pytest test function  
@pytest.mark.asyncio  
async def test\_get\_weather\_schema\_conformance(mcp\_client):  
    \# mcp\_client is a fixture that sends a request and gets a response  
    response\_json \= await mcp\_client.call\_tool("get\_weather", {"city": "London"})

    \# Layer 2 check  
    assert "result" in response\_json  
    tool\_output \= response\_json\["result"\]

    \# Layer 3: Schema Validation  
    try:  
        \# Attempt to parse the result into the Pydantic model  
        report \= WeatherReport.model\_validate(tool\_output)  
        \# If this succeeds, the schema is valid  
        assert report.location \== "London"  
    except ValidationError as e:  
        \# If parsing fails, fail the test with the detailed validation error  
        pytest.fail(f"Tool output did not match expected schema: {e}")

#### **TypeScript Example with Zod**

The same principle applies in the TypeScript ecosystem using Zod.

TypeScript

import { z } from 'zod';  
import { test, expect } from '@jest/globals';

// Define the Zod schema for the tool's output  
const WeatherReportSchema \= z.object({  
  location: z.string(),  
  temperature: z.number(),  
  unit: z.enum(\['Celsius', 'Fahrenheit'\]),  
  conditions: z.string(),  
});

test('get\_weather tool should return a valid schema', async () \=\> {  
  // Assume getToolResponse is a function that calls the tool and returns the result  
  const toolOutput \= await getToolResponse('get\_weather', { city: 'London' });

  // Layer 3: Schema Validation  
  const validationResult \= WeatherReportSchema.safeParse(toolOutput);

  // Assert that the parsing was successful  
  expect(validationResult.success).toBe(true);

  if (validationResult.success) {  
    // Optional Layer 4 check  
    expect(validationResult.data.location).toBe('London');  
  } else {  
    // Fail test with Zod's formatted error message  
    fail(\`Schema validation failed: ${validationResult.error.format()}\`);  
  }  
});

### **6.4 Layer 4: Semantic Data Assertions**

The final layer of validation moves beyond structure to content. After confirming that the response is well-formed and conforms to the expected schema, the test must verify that the data itself is *correct*. This is the domain of traditional functional testing.

* **Known Input, Known Output:** For a deterministic tool, the test should provide a known input and assert that the output is a specific, expected value. For a calculator/add tool, a test calling it with {"a": 2, "b": 3} should assert that response.result.sum is exactly 5\.  
* **Business Logic Validation:** For more complex tools, assertions should validate the underlying business logic. If a get\_user tool is called with a valid ID, the test should assert that the email field in the returned user object matches the known email for that ID in the test database.  
* **State Change Verification:** For tools with side effects (e.g., create\_document), the test must go beyond the tool's response. It should make a subsequent call to another tool (e.g., get\_document) or query the underlying system directly to verify that the expected state change has occurred.
