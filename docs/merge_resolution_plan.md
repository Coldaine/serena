# Merge Resolution Plan: Integrating Upstream Changes

**Date:** 2025-07-07

## 1. Objective

The goal of this plan is to safely and accurately merge the `upstream/main` branch into the local `main` branch. This involves resolving a significant merge conflict caused by a major code refactoring in the upstream repository, where the `src/serena/tools.py` file was converted into a `tools` package (directory). We must ensure all local modifications are preserved and correctly integrated into the new project structure.

## 2. Detailed Plan

### Phase 1: Resolve the `tools.py` Refactoring Conflict

This is the most critical phase. We will handle the structural change first, then re-integrate your custom logic.

*   **Step 1.1: Adopt the Upstream Structure**
    *   **Action:** Formally resolve the "modify/delete" conflict by accepting the upstream repository's changes.
    *   **Commands:**
        1.  `git rm src/serena/tools.py` - This command will remove our modified version of `tools.py`, resolving the conflict by siding with the upstream deletion.
        2.  `git checkout upstream/main -- src/serena/tools` - This command will pull the new `src/serena/tools` directory and its contents from the upstream branch into our working directory.
        3.  `git add src/serena/tools` - This command will stage the new `tools` package, preparing it for the merge commit.
    *   **Outcome:** Our local branch will now reflect the new, refactored code structure from the original repository.

*   **Step 1.2: Analyze and Re-integrate Your Custom Changes**
    *   **Action:** We need to identify the specific changes you made to the old `tools.py` and carefully move them into the appropriate new files within the `src/serena/tools/` package.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Isolate Your Changes:** I will programmatically find the exact modifications you made to `tools.py` before the merge began. I will save these changes to a temporary file for our reference.
        2.  **Map Changes to New Files:** I will analyze each of your modifications and determine its correct new location. For example:
            *   Changes to the `Tool` base class will go into `src/serena/tools/tools_base.py`.
            *   Changes to file-related tools (like `ReadFileTool` or `ListDirTool`) will go into `src/serena/tools/file_tools.py`.
            *   Changes to language server tools (like `FindSymbolTool`) will go into `src/serena/tools/ls_tools.py`.
        3.  **Apply Changes Incrementally:** For each modification, I will present the code change and its proposed new location. Upon your approval, I will use the editing tool to insert the code into the correct file. We will do this for every one of your changes to ensure nothing is lost.

### Phase 2: Review Auto-Merged Files

Git attempted to auto-merge `pyproject.toml` and `README.md`. We will not trust this blindly and will review the changes manually.

*   **Step 2.1: Review `pyproject.toml`**
    *   **Action:** I will display the differences that were merged into this file from the upstream branch. These changes likely involve updated dependencies or project metadata.
    *   **Verification:** You will review and approve these changes before we proceed.

*   **Step 2.2: Review `README.md`**
    *   **Action:** I will display the changes merged into the `README.md` file.
    *   **Verification:** You will review the documentation changes to ensure they are accurate and acceptable.

### Phase 3: Finalize the Merge

Once all conflicts are resolved and all changes are approved, we will complete the merge.

*   **Step 3.1: Stage All Resolved Files**
    *   **Action:** I will add all the files we have worked on (`.gitignore`, the new files in `src/serena/tools/`, `pyproject.toml`, and `README.md`) to the staging area.
    *   **Verification:** I will run `git status` to show you that the merge is ready to be committed and all conflicts are resolved.

*   **Step 3.2: Commit the Merge**
    *   **Action:** I will execute the final `git commit` command.
    *   **Outcome:** This will create a new merge commit in your `main` branch's history, successfully integrating the upstream changes with your work.
